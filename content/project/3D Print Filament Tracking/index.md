This project involved the design and fabrication of a custom inventory tracking system for 3D printer filament used in the UW–Madison Design Innovation Lab. The system enables real-time monitoring of filament stock by integrating load cell sensors into filament storage shelves, helping lab staff maintain supply levels and streamline the re-ordering process.

The device consists of custom-cut shelving units embedded with digital scales to measure filament spool weights. When stock falls below a preset threshold, the system sends a notification to prompt restocking. All components—including the shelf structure and electronic enclosure—were designed and fabricated in-house. Fabrication involved the use of saws and sanders for the shelves and 3D printing for custom enclosures.

The project utilized microcontrollers to interface with load cells and collect weight data, which is transmitted to a web-based monitoring interface. While another graduate student contributed to the web integration, all physical design, fabrication, and embedded electronics work was completed independently.

This project was completed over the course of a semester as part of ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency within the makerspace.
