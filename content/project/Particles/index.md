For experiments concerning plastic particle beaching, I have created a wide range of plastic particles in different sizes, shapes, and types. I have fabricated these particles using a CNC router, waterjet, laser cutter, and 3D printers. Each fabrication technique offers distinct advantages and disadvantages.
