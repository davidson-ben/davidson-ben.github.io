For experiments concerning plastic particle beaching, I have created a wide range of plastic particles in different sizes, shapes, and types. For various materials and particle characteristics, I have used various fabrication techniques, each of which offers distinct advantages and disadvantages.

**Tools used**
- CNC Router
- Waterjet
- Lasercutter
- FMD & SLA 3D Printers
- Various hand tools for finishing
