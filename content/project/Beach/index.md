During the fall of 2020, I designed and constructed a beach for the Water Science and Engineering Lab's wave flume at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, intended for microplastic beaching experiments. The beach is built using 80/20 extruded aluminum T-slot frames, secured with a combination of standard and custom fasteners. The surface is made of 1/2" acrylic, attached to the frame and covered with white contact paper to create an opaque surface for imaging. Additionally, I designed a wooden frame to support two cameras above the beach surface for experimental imaging.
