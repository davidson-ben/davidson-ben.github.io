In April 2024, Ben developed and hosted an outreach event between the Fluid Mechanics in Environmental Processes (FMEP) Group at UW-Madison and a group of high school students from Madison East High School (MEHS).  The event was focused around a live coding activity where students learned how to mathematically model plastic pollution on beaches in MATLAB.  The code files and original handout are [available here](https://github.com/davidson-ben/mathematical_modeling_outreach_2023).
