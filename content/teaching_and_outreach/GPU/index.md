Each summer we join the Wisconsin Sea Grant in leading a session for [Grandparents University](https://uwalumni.com/grandparents-university/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Through this program, we host elementary and middle school aged students with their grandparents in our lab to explore the topics of waves and microplasitc pollution.  Ben has led the lab tour and wave demonstrations in the summers of 2022 and 2023.

We will be joining with the Wisconsin Sea Grant again in the summer of 2025 to lead demonstations in the Water Science and Engineering Laboratory wave flume for Grandparents University.
