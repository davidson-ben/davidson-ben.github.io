Page under construction.

Each summer we join the Wisconsin Sea Grant participation with [Grandparents University](https://uwalumni.com/grandparents-university/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Through this program, we host elementary and middle school aged students and their grandparents in our lab to explore the topics of waves and microplasitc pollution.  Ben has led the lab tour and wave demonstrations in the summers of 2022 and 2023.
