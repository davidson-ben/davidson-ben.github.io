Ben began the Fabrication Fellowship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Design & Innovation (D&I) Lab in August 2023.  The D&I Lab is a campus makerspace equiped with a variety of design and prototyping tools.  As a Fabrication Fellow, Ben served as a student shop manager, overseeing undergraduate staff members and assisting users with their projects.

Ben oversaw all 3D printing activities in the lab.  The D&I Lab houses over 30 3D printers (FDM, SLA, and SLS) and produces over 2,000 individual prints for campus users each semester.  In managing the 3D printing area, Ben organized student workers to maintain printers, assist users, stock materials, and ensure the smooth operation of the space.  Ben also played a key role in transitioning the fleet of printers to next-generation models, optimizing the user experience, and helping to oversee the development of an automatic print queue system.
