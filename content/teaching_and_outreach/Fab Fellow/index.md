Ben began the Fabrication Fellowship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Design & Innovation (D&I) Lab in August 2023.  The D&I Lab is a campus makerspace equiped with a variety of design and prototyping tools.  As a Fabrication Fellow, Ben served as a student shop manager, overseeing undergraduate staff members and assisting users with their projects.

Ben oversaw all 3D printing activities in the lab.  The Design and Innovation Lab has over 30 3D printers (FDM, SLA, and SLS) and produces over 2,000 individual prints for campus users each semester.  In overseeing the 3D printing area, Ben was in charge of organizing student workers to maintain printers, help users, stock materials, and generally maintain the space.  Over Ben's time working in the D&I Lab, he was a part of transitioning the fleet of printers to next generation models, optimizing the user experience, and overseeing the development of an automatic print queue system.
