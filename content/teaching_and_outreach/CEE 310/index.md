In Fall 2021 and Fall 2022, Ben served as a Teaching Assistant for the Civil & Environemntal Engineering course, _CEE 310: Introductory Fluid Mechanics_.  Throughout the semester, Ben led weekly discussions to reinforce lecture material and supervised hands-on laboratory experiments.  These experiments provided students with practical experience, allowing them to apply the fluid mechanics pricipals they studied in lecures in a hands-on environment.
