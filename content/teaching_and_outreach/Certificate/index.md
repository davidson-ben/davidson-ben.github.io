In August 2024, Ben completed the requirements for the *Delta Certificate in Research, Teaching, and Learning* at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The Delta program at UW-Madison fosters growth in teaching, outreach, and mentoring in the context of reasearch.  The certificate is based on several seminar courses and culminates in a final project where evidence-based practices are implemented in a classroom setting.

## Delta Courses
- Research Mentor Training
- Emerging Technologies and Accelerating Change: Preparing for tomorrow's college classroom
- Improv to Improve Science Communication and Teaching
- Workshop in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis

## Final Project
[For the final project](/teaching_and_outreach/delta/), Ben developed an outreach activity for local high school students to learn about plastic ocean pollution through a hands on coding activity.
