Across several of my own research proejcts, I have had the opportunity to involve undergraduate students in my work.  In this way, I have been able to provide a critical learning experience for undergraduate students interested in resarch.  In conjunction with the students involved in my work, I have also taken a research mentor training as part of my [Delta Certificate in Teaching, Learning and Research]().

### Microplastics on Beaches in Lake Superior
- **Kallyn Batista** (Spring/Summer 2021): Kallyn assisted with setting up and conducting field experiments to collect sand samples from Lake Superior.  Additionally, Kallyn played a significant role in performing the microplastic separation procedures.
- **Sabeel Samrah** (Fall 2021 - Summer 2022): Sabeel assisted in identifying and counting microplastic particles from processed samples. Additionally, Sabeel processed raw beach sand and analyzed the sediment characteristics.
- **Achievements:** Kallyn and Sabeel both presented in the campus undergraduate research symposium.  This research project, including the contributions of both Kallyn and Sabeel, was [published in 2022](/publication/1-davidson-microplastic-2022).

### Marine Debris Modeling and Experiments
- **Jamie Brenner** (Fall 2022 - Summer 2023): Jamie contributed to developing the 1D and 2D swash zone models for buoyant marine debris and further assisted with laboratory experiments at Queen's University
- **Ethan Steichen** (Summer 2024): Ethan assisted with the laboratory experiments at Queen's University.
- **Achievements:** Jamie presented a poster on the 2D beaching model at the 2023 Young Coastal Scientists and Engineers Conference - Americas.  Additionally, the 1D swash zone marine debris model was  [published in 2023](/publication/2-davidson-beaching-2023).
