 abstract = {Marine debris pollution is a growing problem impacting aquatic ecosystems, coastal recreation and human society. Beaches are known to be a sink for debris, and beaching needs to be accounted for in marine debris mass balances, but the process of buoyant debris beaching is not yet suﬃciently well understood in order for it to be included in coastal models. We develop a simpliﬁed model for buoyant marine debris transport in bore-driven swash (where swash refers to the area that the water wets the beach with each incoming wave). We validate the model with laboratory experiments and use the combined results from the model and experiments to understand the parameters that are important for dictating particle beaching. The most relevant parameters are the particle inertia and the initial conditions with which debris particles enter the swash zone.},
