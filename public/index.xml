      <title>CoPartCoFlow Summer School in France</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/copartcoflow/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, I had the opportunity to participate in the CoPartCoFlow summer school, held in La londe les Maures, France. The week-long program focused on complex particles in complex flows and brought together researchers from across disciplines to explore the behavior, modeling, and measurement of particle-laden flows in environmental settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format combined lectures from leading scientists, poster sessions, and hands-on components that encouraged collaboration and discussion. Topics ranged from particle dynamics and turbulent transport to modeling approaches and experimental techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the program, I presented my ongoing research on the flow and transport of debris and contaminants in the swash zone. This work investigates how plastic pollution or solute contamination move throughout the coastal zone, in a highly unsteady and spatially variable environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical content, it was a truly rewarding experience to meet other early-career researchers and engage with experts whose work I have long admired. The conversations and connections formed during the week have already influenced my thinking and opened the door to future collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the organizers and instructors who made the week so valuable, and to all the participants for fostering such a collegial and stimulating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D Print Filament Inventory Tracking</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/project/3d-print-filament-tracking/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/project/3d-print-filament-tracking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project involved the design and fabrication of a custom inventory tracking system for 3D printer filament used in the UW–Madison Design Innovation Lab. The system enables real-time monitoring of filament stock by integrating load cell sensors into filament storage shelves, helping lab staff maintain supply levels and streamline the re-ordering process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device consists of custom-cut shelving units embedded with digital scales to measure filament spool weights. When stock falls below a preset threshold, the system sends a notification to prompt restocking. All components—including the shelf structure and electronic enclosure—were designed and fabricated in-house. Fabrication involved the use of saws and sanders for the shelves and 3D printing for custom enclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project utilized microcontrollers to interface with load cells and collect weight data, which is transmitted to a web-based monitoring interface. While another graduate student contributed to the web integration, all physical design, fabrication, and embedded electronics work was completed independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was completed over the course of a semester as part of ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency within the makerspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, Ben completed the requirements for the &lt;em&gt;Delta Certificate in Research, Teaching, and Learning&lt;/em&gt; at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The Delta program at UW-Madison fosters growth in teaching, outreach, and mentoring in the context of reasearch.  The certificate is based on several seminar courses and culminates in a final project where evidence-based practices are implemented in a classroom setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across several of my research proejcts, I have had the opportunity to involve undergraduate students in my work.  This involvement has allowed me to provide a critical learning experience for students interested in research.  Additionally, I have completed research mentor training as part of my &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/teaching_and_outreach/certificate/&#34;&gt;Delta Certificate in Teaching, Learning and Research,&lt;/a&gt; further enhancing my ability to support and guide these students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabeel Samrah&lt;/strong&gt; (Fall 2021 - Summer 2022): Sabeel assisted in identifying and counting microplastic particles from processed samples. Additionally, Sabeel processed raw beach sand and analyzed the sediment characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements:&lt;/strong&gt; Kallyn and Sabeel both presented in the campus undergraduate research symposium.  This research project, including the contributions of both Kallyn and Sabeel, was &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/publication/1-davidson-microplastic-2022&#34;&gt;published in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Arduino Camera Trigger</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/project/arduino-trigger/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/project/arduino-trigger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed and built a system to synchronize and trigger cameras for experiments in the Queen&amp;rsquo;s University large wave basin. The system is centered around an Arduino, which receives a start trigger from the wave paddle, waits for a specified duration, and then produces a square wave at a specified frequency via a power supply and relay. This output signal triggers the cameras for image capture. Additionally, the trigger system uses LED indicators to show the system status and is housed within a 3D-printed enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also created an adapted version for use at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&amp;rsquo;s Water Science and Engineering Laboratory wave flume. In addition to triggering the cameras, this version also synchronized the image capture with a data acquisition system, which captured wave height data from ultrasonic wave gauges and velocity data from Vectrino ADVs and ADV Profilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, Ben developed and hosted an outreach event between the Fluid Mechanics in Environmental Processes (FMEP) Group at UW-Madison and a group of high school students from Madison East High School (MEHS).  The event was focused around a live coding activity where students learned how to mathematically model plastic pollution on beaches using MATLAB.  The code files and original handout are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davidson-ben/mathematical_modeling_outreach_2023&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing and leading this outreach event was the final project for the Delta Certificate in Research, Teaching, and Learning.  Over the course of the semester, Ben worked on developing a literature informed activity to engage diverse students in learning to code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ben began the Fabrication Fellowship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Design &amp;amp; Innovation (D&amp;amp;I) Lab in August 2023.  The D&amp;amp;I Lab is a campus makerspace equiped with a variety of design and prototyping tools.  As a Fabrication Fellow, Ben served as a student shop manager, overseeing undergraduate staff members and assisting users with their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben oversaw all 3D printing activities in the lab.  The D&amp;amp;I Lab houses over 30 3D printers (FDM, SLA, and SLS) and produces over 2,000 individual prints for campus users each semester.  In managing the 3D printing area, Ben organized student workers to maintain printers, assist users, stock materials, and ensure the smooth operation of the space.  Ben also played a key role in transitioning the fleet of printers to next-generation models, optimizing the user experience, and helping to oversee the development of an automatic print queue system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/project/beach/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the fall of 2020, I designed and constructed a beach for the Water Science and Engineering Lab&amp;rsquo;s wave flume at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, intended for microplastic beaching experiments. The beach is built using 80/20 extruded aluminum T-slot frames, secured with a combination of standard and custom fasteners. The surface is made of 1/2&amp;quot; acrylic, attached to the frame and covered with white contact paper to create an opaque surface for imaging. Additionally, I designed a wooden frame to support two cameras above the beach surface for experimental imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
